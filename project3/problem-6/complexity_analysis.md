# Unsorted integer array min max implementation analysis

For this problem we traverse the input list and with help of two pointers compare current min/max value and replace the values if needed
The algorithm finds the solution within single traversal in order of O(n), linear complexity. Requires no additional memory.

Complexities:
* `Runtime O(n)`, where n is the size of input list
* `Space O(1)`, no additional memory required
