# Algorithms and Datastructures

## Project Summary
This repository contains solutions on a series of real-world open ended problems like: 
* Advanced Data Structures: `Stack`, `Queue`, `Hash Tables`, `LinkedList`, `Binary Tree`, `Trie`, `Red-Black Tree`, `Heap`, `Graph`
* Popular programming problems: `LRU Cache`, `Huffman Compression Algorithm`, `File Recursion`, `Blockchain`, `Active Directory`
* Searching Algorithms: `Binary Search`, `Depth First Search`, `Breadth First Search` 
* Sorting Algorithms: `Buble sort`, `Merge sort`, `Quick sort`, `Heap sort`
* Faster Divide & Conquer Algorithms: `k-th largest element`, `max sum sub-array`
* Greedy Algorithms
* Graphs Problem: `Best First Search` a.k.a. `A* Algorithm`
* Dynamic Programming

Disclaimer:
All solutions were implemented myself as a part of Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree
